Code for serving information about publishing platforms and conversion data from various data-sources into the Publication Platform Framework format.

* Modules

To run any python script directly, please add the environment variable =PYTHONPATH= containing the path to the =src/= folder to your environment to make sure that the sub-modules can be found.

The application can be configured by providing the =config/job.conf= file. Documentation of this file can be found in =config/template.conf=.

** Bulk

The bulk module (=src/bulk/=) contains all the necessary code to download the (latest version of the) data for various sources of journal-information. Currently, the following sources are supported:

- Openalex
- Directory of Open Acces Journals (DOAJ)
- Sherpa Romeo

Also provided are a set of excel files (=data/publisher_peer_review/xlsx=), directly obtained from collaborating publishers, containing information about the peer-review policies of their journals in accordance with the [[file:docs/STM_Peer_Review_Terminology (2.1).pdf][STM peer-review terminology]].  

Additionally, there is support to load ISSN-L information from ISSN, which links ISSN identifiers to ISSN-L identifiers.

For each data source, the data can be downloaded by setting the appropriate configuration settings in =config/job.conf= and running =python bulk/bulk_{source}.py=. This will download the data to the folder specified in the =data_path= configuration option of the source.

** Store

The store module converts platform-data from various sources into separate PADs. Currently, the following sources are supported:

- Openalex (JSON, from bulk module result)
- Directory of Open Acces Journals (JSON, from bulk module result)
- Sherpa Romeo (JSON, from bulk module result)
- Publisher Peer Review (JSON, from bulk module result)
- ISSNL (CSV, from bulk module result)
- Wikidata (SPARQL, directly from endpoint)

[[file:docs/img/job_prototype-Translation.drawio.png]]

Translation between JSON data and PADs is relatively easy to extend. The functions in =json_convert.py= provide a generic way to add a context to a JSON document, and then converting the resulting document by providing a SPARQL query which inserts the appropriate graphs.

CSV data is currently handled by converting the data into JSON using a custom script, and then following the same procedure as outlined above. 

Data sources which provide a SPARQL endpoint only need a list of platform identifiers and a SPARQL query to convert the data.

PADs are stored directly in a compatible triple store via a SPARQL-endpoint.

** Unification

A very basic example of unification of PADs can be found in the =store.job_unify= module. This module clusters PADs on any matching object of =dcterms:identifier= for a =ppo:Platform=. These pads are collected, the assertions are unified and the source pads are linked via the =pad:hasSourceAssertion= property. The resulting pads are stored in a compatible triple store via a SPARQL-endpoint. This triple store is the basis for the [[https://app.journalobservatory.org][JournalObservatory prototype]].

* Design decisions
** =@context=

To transform JSON into RDF, generally the only thing that is needed is to add a context. In JSON-LD, this context is just syntactic sugar, it provides short names for identifiers. We can use it to transform JSON into JSON-LD by defining the JSON keys as shortcuts for proper identifiers.

There are some issues with this approach. For one, it can be hard to find identifiers for some keys, because the original designers did not need to think about this. Keys like ="name"= can be simple enough (for instance: <https://schema.org/name>), but for =publisher_policy.permitted_oa.embargo= it can be difficult to find an ontology which already describes this key. It would be the most efficient if data-providers themselves describe the keys in their JSON data (and provide identifiers). Another solution can be to provide an ad-hoc dummy identifier, and just prefix the key with the website of the data-provider. =publisher_policy.permitted_oa.embargo= will become <https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/id/publisher_policy_permitted_oa_embargo> or =romeo:publisher_policy_permitted_oa_embargo=. This can be done by constructing the =@context= by hand, or providing the =@vocab= JSON-LD keyword.

Adding the =@vocab= keyword can have unintended side effects like key-collisions so it is not recommended. A On the other hand, failing to define keys while not providing the =@vocab= keyword leads to omission of that key when converting the JSON-LD to RDF.

On of the main uses for JSON is defining nested data. RDF does support nesting, but as it is built on the idea of triples, nesting can be unintuitive. In RDF nested data structures need an intermediate node.

See the following example:

=json-ld-to-turtle()=
#+name: jld-to-ttl
#+begin_src python :results output :wrap example ttl :var record=approach1
import json
from rdflib import Graph
from pyld import jsonld
record = json.loads(record)
record = jsonld.compact(record, record["@context"])
g = Graph().parse(data=record, format="json-ld")
print(g.serialize(format="turtle").strip())
#+end_src

=approach 1=
#+name: approach1
#+begin_example json
{
  "@context": {
    "ex": "https://example.org/",
    "@vocab": "https://example.org/",
    "@base": "https://example.org/",
    "id": "@id"
  },
  "id": "example",
  "nest": {
    "key1": "value1",
    "key2": "value2"
  }
}
#+end_example

=->=
#+call: jld-to-ttl(approach1)
#+begin_example ttl
@prefix ex: <https://example.org/> .

ex:example ex:nest [ ex:key1 "value1" ;
            ex:key2 "value2" ] .
#+end_example

In theory, we do not need the "nest" key from the example. It has no actual value, so the "key1" and "key2" properties could be properties of =ex:example= as well:

=approach 2=
#+name: approach2
#+begin_example json
{
  "@context": {
    "ex": "https://example.org/",
    "@base": "https://example.org/",
    "nest": "@nest",
    "key1": "ex:nest_key1",
    "key2": "ex:nest_key2"
  },
  "@graph": {
    "@id": "example",
    "nest": {
      "key1": "value1",
      "key2": "value2"
    }
  }
}
 #+end_example
 
=->=
#+call: jld-to-ttl(approach2)
#+begin_example ttl
@prefix ex: <https://example.org/> .

ex:example ex:nest_key1 "value1" ;
    ex:nest_key2 "value2" .
#+end_example

However, because there is no ambiguity using the same key name in a different nested structure in JSON, this can lead to ambiguity in RDF:

=approach 3=
#+name: approach3
#+begin_example json
{
  "@context": {
    "ex": "https://example.org/",
    "@base": "https://example.org/",
    "nest1": "@nest",
    "nest2": "@nest",
    "key": "ex:key"
  },
  "@graph": {
    "@id": "example",
    "nest1": {
      "key": "value1"
    },
    "nest2": {
      "key": "value2"
    }
  }
}
#+end_example

=->=
#+call: jld-to-ttl(approach3)
#+begin_example ttl
@prefix ex: <https://example.org/> .

ex:example ex:key "value1",
        "value2" .
#+end_example

The "key" property of "nest1" and the key property of "nest2" might have different meanings in the JSON structure, but this meaning is lost in the conversion to RDF. A better way to deal with this is to use 'scoped contexts' to mirror the nested structure of the JSON:

=approach 4=
#+name: approach4
#+begin_example json
{
  "@context": {
    "ex": "https://example.org/",
    "@base": "https://example.org/",
    "nest1": {
      "@id": "ex:nest1",
      "@context": {
        "key": "ex:nest1_key"
      }
    },
    "nest2": {
      "@id": "ex:nest2",
      "@context": {
        "key": "ex:nest2_key"
      }
    }
  },
  "@graph": {
    "@id": "example",
    "nest1": {
      "key": "value1"
    },
    "nest2": {
      "key": "value2"
    }
  }
}
 #+end_example
 
=->=
#+call: jld-to-ttl(approach4)
#+begin_example ttl
@prefix ex: <https://example.org/> .

ex:example ex:nest1 [ ex:nest1_key "value1" ] ;
    ex:nest2 [ ex:nest2_key "value2" ] .
#+end_example

Note that we cannot use the =@nest= keyword to get rid of the blank nodes that are introduced this way as the scoped context of =@nest= objects is ignored during conversion, meaning the "key" properties are not included in the resulting RDF graph.

To minimize the use of blank nodes, as they can complicate the data-structure, it is recommended to use [[approach2]] or [[approach3]] when it does not lead to ambiguity and to use [[approach4]] otherwise.

** SPARQL patterns

*** Mapping

Use the =VALUES= keyword to match variables to new types.
In this case we translate =schema:eissn= to =ppo:hasEISSN= and =schema:pissn= to =ppo:hasPISSN=.

#+begin_src sparql
construct {
    ?journal ?hasissn ?issn .
where {
    ?journal ?issntype ?issn .
    values (?issntype ?hasissn) {
        (schema:eissn ppo:hasEISSN)
        (schema:pissn ppo:hasPISSN)
    }
}
#+end_src

*** Preference

Use the =OPTIONAL=, =COALESCE= and =FILTER= keywords in tandem to define an order of preference for specific terms.

In this case, we define a preference for the eissn of a journal to the pissn. We use the =OPTIONAL= keyword to make sure that records are not duplicated when both eissn and pissn exist (they will both be matched to the same record). We use the =COALESCE= keyword to obtain the first defined term in order of preference. Even though both issn types are optional, we do want to match on either of them, for this we use the =FILTER= keyword.

#+begin_src sparql
construct {
    ?journal ppo:hasISSN ?issn .
}
where {
    optional { ?journal schema:pissn ?pissn } .
    optional { ?journal schema:eissn ?eissn } .
    bind(coalesce(?eissn, ?pissn) as ?issn)
    ?journal ?issntype ?issn .
    filter (?issntype in (schema:eissn, schema:pissn))
}
#+end_src

*** Assertions in SPARQL

It is advisable to split up SPARQL queries that construct a PAD to have a query for different parts of the assertion. Not only does this simplify the query and lead to better readability, it also makes sure that there are no empty assertions and it minimizes the "explosive growth of BNodes".
